<h1>Web Scraper with Data Processing</h1>
<h2>Conor McDevitt </h2>

<h2>Installations</h2>
<p>jsoncpp package https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The point of this project is to to scrape data into a file using python, and then use that data in a c++ program that uses algorithms on the data. I use python because of its ease of use when scraping a website, and c++ for its speed</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Area doesn't convert to int or float</li>
<li>Taking user input from c++ file doesn't work</li>
</ul>


<h2>Future Work </h2>
<p>Tried to make a higher lower game with the data but had trouble getting user input, so wansn't able to build it in time. Ideally the website scraped would have a lot of data on it to process, so you get the full benefit of using C++</p>
